					<h2>The Secont Week</h2>
						<article><p>When I started ths blog, I used lorem ipsum as placeholder text. Five whole paragraphs of it. In retrospect, it was a missed oppurtunity to actually document the week to week progress I make at NSS. Going forward, that's what I'll use this for. This past week was the second week and things are progressing. I thought I had a better handle on HTML and CSS than I actually do, but that's ok. I figured out some of the mistakes I was making and I'm learning not to make them over and over again. I've also embraced the MVP ethos-- its more important that things work like they're supposed to rather than look nice. I need to continue to keep that in mind. I mean, things should still look nice, but I shouldn't waste time picking the perfect typography if the JavaScript won't run. Which brings me to my next point. JavaScript. I need to practice. I understand the concepts but putting into into practice isn't alway the easiest. I'm confident I can pick it up though. Ok. That's all for this week.</p></article>
