					<h2>The Secont Week</h2>

					<p class="date">April 17th, 2017</p>

						<article><p>When I started ths blog, I used lorem ipsum as placeholder text. Five whole paragraphs of it. In retrospect, it was a missed oppurtunity to actually document the week to week progress I make at NSS. Going forward, that's what I'll use this for. This past week was the second week and things are progressing. I thought I had a better handle on HTML and CSS than I actually do, but that's ok. I figured out some of the mistakes I was making and I'm learning not to make them over and over again. I've also embraced the MVP ethos-- its more important that things work like they're supposed to rather than look nice. I need to continue to keep that in mind. I mean, things should still look nice, but I shouldn't waste time picking the perfect typography if the JavaScript won't run.</p>
						<p>Which brings me to my next point. JavaScript. I need to practice. I understand the concepts but putting into into practice isn't alway the easiest. I'm confident I can pick it up though. Git has been a little confusing for me too, but I've been committing a lot more lately and everytime it gets easier. I guess that's probably the way all of this is going to work. Someday it'll just click. I hope.</p>

						<p>Oh, and I need to get better about my indentation and layout. Some of these HTML files have been a mess. I'm sure whitespace has been a nightmare too. At least I know its a problem that needs to be addressed. And this blog is a perfect lab to experiment in.</p>

						<p>Ok. That's all for this week.</p>

						<p>I wasn't planning on messing with the CSS, but I just loaded the page and God its ugly. Sorry to anyone who has already looked at this page.</p>
