						<article>
						<p>When I started ths blog, I used lorem ipsum as placeholder text. Five whole paragraphs of it. In retrospect, it was a missed oppurtunity to actually document the week to week progress I make at NSS. Going forward, that's what I'll use this for. This past week was the second week and things are progressing. I thought I had a better handle on HTML and CSS than I actually do, but that's ok. I figured out some of the mistakes I was making and I'm learning not to make them over and over again. I've also embraced the MVP ethos-- its more important that things work like they're supposed to rather than look nice. I need to continue to keep that in mind. I mean, things should still look nice, but I shouldn't waste time picking the perfect typography if the JavaScript won't run. Which brings me to my next point. JavaScript. I need to practice. I understand the concepts but putting into into practice isn't alway the easiest. I'm confident I can pick it up though. Ok. That's all for this week.</p>

						<h2 class="weekly" class="text-left">The Third Week</h2>
						<article>
						<p>The third week is down and things are starting to gel. JavaScript is still challenging, but its starting to make sense. I'm still having trouble with some aspects, but I feel like I am making progress. As things get more complex it becomes easier to grasp the basic concepts. Its hard to explain, but its like looking at something from the next level and then finally understanding the purpose.</p>
						<p>We also were introduced to Sass, Bootstrap and Materialize. All of these make CSS styling more efficient, uniformed and, most importantly, less time consuming. I really like Sass and need to play around with Bootstrap/Materialize some more.</p>
						<p>Git is getting easier, too. I'm not making the same mistakes I was a few weeks ago. I'm making it a point to commit more often not only because its probably a good habit to get into, but also because its giving me more exposure to the commit process. I'm staring to feel more comfortable with the process. I've also starting including markdowns in all my commits. Again, this is mostly to get in the habit of doing it-- most of the actual text is just "here's what I did and here's what you're looking for".</p>
						<p>Hopefully next week's post will also be optimistic.</p>

						<h2 class="weekly" class="text-left">The Fourth Week</h2>
						<article>
						<p>Another week is down and things are still moving along. This week we covered IIFE's and XHR, concept that I understand but I'm still trying to figure out how to execute. Like anything else we learn, its going to take doing it over and over again in order to fully understand how the concept works.</p>
						<p>Complete comprehension of JavaScript is still elusive, but I've been thumbing through <i>JavaScript and JQuery</i> by John Duckett and I've been finding that very helpful. It's more in-depth that W3Schools.com and more readable than MDN. When I come to something I don't understand, which is often, I go to the websites first (because its easier) and if I'm still not clear, I go right to Duckett. I haven't looked at his JQuery yet-- mostly because I don't want to confuse myself-- but I'm sure it will be just as helpful when I get there.</p>
						<p>Last weekend, I ran into a friend of mine that is a full time programmer. He asked me how the bootcamp was going and what languages I was learning. When I mentioned JavaScript he rolled his eyes and started complaining about JS. He has a CS Degree and uses multiple programing languages on regular basis and <strong>he still finds JavaScript difficult to grasp</strong>. I took some comfort in that.
