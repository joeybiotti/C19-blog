In retrospect, it was a missed oppurtunity to actually document the week to week progress I make at NSS. Going forward, that's what I'll use this for. This past week was the second week and things are progressing. I thought I had a better handle on HTML and CSS than I actually do, but that's ok. I figured out some of the mistakes I was making and I'm learning not to make them over and over again. I've also embraced the MVP ethos-- its more important that things work like they're supposed to rather than look nice. I need to continue to keep that in mind. I mean, things should still look nice, but I shouldn't waste time picking the perfect typography if the JavaScript won't run. Which brings me to my next point. JavaScript. I need to practice. I understand the concepts but putting into into practice isn't alway the easiest. I'm confident I can pick it up though. Ok. That's all for this week."

        "Bpost": "The third week is down and things are starting to gel. JavaScript is still challenging, but its starting to make sense. I'm still having trouble with some aspects, but I feel like I am making progress. As things get more complex it becomes easier to grasp the basic concepts. Its hard to explain, but its like looking at something from the next level and then finally understanding the purpose. We also were introduced to Sass, Bootstrap and Materialize. All of these make CSS styling more efficient, uniformed and, most importantly, less time consuming. I really like Sass and need to play around with Bootstrap/Materialize some more.</p><p>Git is getting easier, too. I'm not making the same mistakes I was a few weeks ago. I'm making it a point to commit more often not only because its probably a good habit to get into, but also because its giving me more exposure to the commit process. I'm staring to feel more comfortable with the process. I've also starting including markdowns in all my commits. Again, this is mostly to get in the habit of doing it-- most of the actual text is just 'here's what I did and here's what you're looking for'.</p><p>Hopefully next week's post will also be optimistic.</p>"

        "Bpost": "Another week is down and things are still moving along. This week we covered IIFE's and XHR, concept that I understand but I'm still trying to figure out how to execute. Like anything else we learn, its going to take doing it over and over again in order to fully understand how the concept works.</p><p>Complete comprehension of JavaScript is still elusive, but I've been thumbing through <i>JavaScript and JQuery</i> by John Duckett and I've been finding that very helpful. It's more in-depth that W3Schools.com and more readable than MDN. When I come to something I don't understand, which is often, I go to the websites first (because its easier) and if I'm still not clear, I go right to Duckett. I haven't looked at his JQuery yet-- mostly because I don't want to confuse myself-- but I'm sure it will be just as helpful when I get there.</p><p>Last weekend, I ran into a friend of mine that is a full time programmer. He asked me how the bootcamp was going and what languages I was learning. When I mentioned JavaScript he rolled his eyes and started complaining about JS. He has a CS Degree and uses multiple programing languages on regular basis and <strong>he still finds JavaScript difficult to grasp</strong>. I took some comfort in that.</p>"

        "Bweek": "Week Five",
        "Bpost": "Another week is down. Things are still moving suepr fast, but I think I'm grasping everything. This week we mostly worked on a group project, which ended up being really fun. It also felt like the first real web app we've built. The translator was pretty involved, but Chatty actually seemed like something you'd find on the internet. It ended up being a lot of fun.</p><p>I'm still pretty surprised how often I struggle with something only for it to start making sense when we move on to the next step. I guess it's because some of the concepts only start to make sense in a larger context. Its happened a few times before and its <i>starting</i> to happen with IIFEs and JSON. I still need to practice those.</p><p>After the projects were presented, we went a little bit deeper with NPM, Bower and Grunt. I can see how something like Grunt makes life easier because it does all the things I tend to forget about! Its not so muhc that it does all the heavy lifting, but it takes care of all the boring stuff.</p><p>We dipped our toes into JQuery this week as well, which I'm pretty excited about. I know its important to be able to read and write plain jane JavaScript, but JQuery looks so much easier. I'm sure there's a learning curve, but I'm looking forward to being able to type less words and more dollar signs.</p>"

        "Bpost": "This week was... intense. I feel like I learned alot, but when I try to actually recall it all, it gets hazy. Here's what I remember:<br> We learned how to use Grunt and Browserify, both of which are extremely helpful and make things <strong>much</strong> easier.<p>Grunt takes care of all the stuff that's easy to forget about, like telling setting Sass to watch CSS. Browserify is a little more complex and I still need to play around with it, but I like being able to compile multiple JavaScript files in to one long file and only having to attach that one. I feel pretty good about setting it up, but I need some practice with it. To get used to the process of installing Grunt and Browserify, I've been adding it to all the projects I've working on, even if I don't intend to use it. For example, there's a Gruntfile for this blog, but I don't actually need it. Although Grunt made practicing Sass much easier, so I guess there's that too.<p>Finally, we worked with Handlebars.js and it made my head hurt. I get the concept and I totally see why its useful, but it felt like a lot to take int at once. Like Grunt and Browserify, I just need to start using it on projects even if I don't actually need to. I was going to last night, but I decided to let it soak in a little bit. My post next week may incorporate Handlebars.js and/or JSON. I need to work more with that, too (JSON). Oh, and I added a little bit of JQuery on this just to make things easier (and practice).<p>All in all, it was a busy week and it felt productive. I've mentioned this before, but with each thing I learn, the more things start to makse sense. Maybe that's what they mean by 'trust the process'. "

        "Bpost": "This week was... intense. The entire week was spent on the theme park group project. I think it ended up pretty good, but there were some hiccups along the way. The biggest take away was the value of planning things out and making sure everyone is on the same page. Luckily our group, but I can see how its very easy to start going down a differnt path than what envisioned or how one person can write some code that will conflict with someone else's. Merge conflicts are inevitable, of course, but if they can be corrected with minimal impact, then I'd say everyone's doing a good job. As the projects get more and more complicated, the need for project managment is become more and more vital. I wasn't lead on this one, but if I was I don't know how much code I'd be able to write. Keeping up with project boards, items and issue tickets almost requires a person to just do that. I guess in a real world setting there probably is someone who fills this role.Every time we do a project, the next one gets easier, so I'm hoping I won't feel so overwhelmed next time.</p><p>We closed out the week with Cohort 17's Demo Day. It was pretty amazing to see what they were able to do. It was also really comforting to hear them all say something similar: 'stick with it'. Everyone I talked said that the first few weeks are really, really hard but then something clicks. I hope I'm getting to that place soon</p><p>Next week we return to lessons and then another group project. It doesn't slow down, but there's a three day weekend on coming up so at least there's that.</p><p>One last thing: I voluntered to be a mentor at the Nashville Acadaemy of Computer Sciences, a local middle school. I'm not sure what I'll be doing exactly, but it should be fun... I hope. I'll have something to say next week.</p>"

        "Bpost": "Another week down and another group project. Movie History. There were a lot more moving pieces and a lot more challenging aspects. I was in a strong group, and after some missteps-- some of which I feel responsible for-- we were making progress and really coming along. Then we had to trade code with another group. Everything we were doing went out the window and we had to try and figure out what their plan was and how far along they were in it. This made things harder, but it did teach me two valuable lessons... One: get comfortable working inheriting other people's code because that's going to happen more often then writing fresh code, and two: comment out code as much as possible. Even if it looks pretty self-explanatory, make a comment. This way, when I open up a file I haven't looked at in weeks or months, I'll be able to quickly figure out what is happening. Perhaps more importantly, it'll make my code more readable to others. I need to develop this habit. Still, I'm now starting to feel like an actual developer, not just someone playing around with HTML. <p>There are days when I feel like I haven't made enough progress and then there are days where I can't believe how far I've come. I need to keep thinking of the latter.<p>I should also admit something regarding this blog. I've been very diligent about writing an entry every week, usually on Fridays. This entry is actually written on Sunday evening. After the last two weeks, I was mentally exhausted and needed a break from coding. I feel refreshed and I'm excited to move into Angular.js."
