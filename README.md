# Weekly Blog

~~A plain old HTML blog.~~ At one time this was a boring blog that was mostly **HTML** and some *very* minor **CSS** styling. Not anymore. Weekly posts are printed to the DOM via **JavaScript** and styling was done with **Sass**. There's some **Bootstrap** and **JQuery** too, but they're not doing anything exciting at the moment. Let's not get carried away. Oh, and as you can see, I'm playing around with Markdown styling, too. Every aspect of this blog is intended to be an experiment. Who knows what'll be thrown into the mix next?!

Like everything else in life, its a work in progress.
