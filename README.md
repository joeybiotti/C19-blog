# Weekly Blog

~~A plain old HTML blog.~~ At one time this was a boring blog that was mostly HTML and some *very* minor CSS styling. Not anymore. Weekly posts are printed to the DOM via JavaScript and styling was done with Sass. There's some Bootstrap, too, but that's mainly just for the navbar. Let's not get carried away.

Like everything else in life, its a work in progress.
